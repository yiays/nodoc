# NoDoc
Create brower-native documents for print

NoDoc extends upon [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js) with tools for creating pages in the browser with paper prints in mind.

These documents can be generated client-side in real time, update live, have interactivity in the browser, and print *exactly as they appear* to paper.
